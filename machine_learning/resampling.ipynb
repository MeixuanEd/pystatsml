The *training error* can be easily calculated by applying the statistical learning method to the observations used in its training. But because of overfitting, the **training error rate can dramatically underestimate the error** that would be obtained on new samples.\n",

    "2. **Validation dataset**: Dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while **tuning model hyperparameters**, ie. **Model selection**. The validation error is the average error that results from a learning method to predict the response on a new (validation) samples that is, on samples that were not used in training the method. \n",

Large training+validation set (80%) small test set (20%) might provide a poor estimation of the predictive performances (same argument stands for train vs validation samples). On the contrary, large test set and small training set might produce a poorly estimated learner. This is why, on situation where we cannot afford such split, cross-validation scheme can be use for model selection or/and for model evaluation.\n",

    "## CV for model selection: setting the hyper parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note CV may be used for two separate goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model assessment**: having chosen a final model, estimating its prediction error (generalization error) on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model selection**: estimating the performance of different models in order to choose the best one. One special case of model selection is the selection model's hyper parameters. Indeed remember that most of learning algorithm have a hyper parameters (typically the regularization parameter) that has to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally we must address the two problems simultaneously. The usual approach for both problems is to randomly divide the dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **training set** (train) is used to fit the models;\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **validation set** (val) is used to estimate prediction error for model selection or to determine the hyper parameters over a grid of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **test set** (test) is used for assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid search procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection of the best hyper parameters over a grid of possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "For each possible values of hyper parameters $\\alpha_k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit the learner on training set: $f(X_{train}, y_{train}, \\alpha_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluate the model on the validation set and keep the parameter(s) that minimises the error measure\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\alpha_* = \\arg \\min L(f(X_{train}), y_{val}, \\alpha_k)$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Nested CV for model selection and assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of time, we cannot afford such three-way split. Thus, again we will use CV, but in this case we need two nested CVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One **outer CV loop, for model assessment**. This CV performs $K$ splits of the dataset into training plus validation ($X_{-K}, y_{-K}$) set and a test set $X_{K}, y_{K}$\n",
    "\n",
    "One **inner CV loop, for model selection**. For each run of the outer loop, the inner loop loop performs $L$ splits of dataset ($X_{-K}, y_{-K}$) into training set: ($X_{-K,-L}, y_{-K,-L}$) and a validation set: ($X_{-K,L}, y_{-K,L}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the inner CV loop combined with the learner form a new learner with an automatic model (parameter) selection procedure. This new learner can be easily constructed using Scikit-learn. The learned is wrapped inside a ``GridSearchCV`` class.\n",
    "\n",
