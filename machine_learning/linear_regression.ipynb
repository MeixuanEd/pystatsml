    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random errors or noise instead of the underlying relationships. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is **excessively complex**, such as having **too many parameters relative to the number of observations**. A model that has been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A learning algorithm is trained using some set of training samples. If the learning algorithm has the capacity to overfit the training samples the performance on the **training sample set** will improve while the performance on unseen **test sample set** will decline.\n",

    " - excessively complex models,\n",
    " - multicollinearity, and\n",
    " - high dimensionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least not within the sample data set; it only affects computations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. In case of perfect multicollinearity the predictor matrix is singular and therefore cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the ordinary least-squares estimator, $\\mathbf{w}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, does not exist.\n",

Thus it is generally a bad idea to add many input features into the learner. This phenomenon is called the **curse of dimensionality**.\n",
